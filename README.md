congest v1.0
============

Interconnect **cong**estion **est**imators

The benchmarks in this suite can be used to estimate the impact of network
topology and congestion on the communication time on an interconnect.

### Build

To compile, edit the Makefile so that the variables are set for the
right architecture.

You will also need the [topomgr](https://github.com/bhatele/topomgr) library
for some of the benchmarks in this suite.
